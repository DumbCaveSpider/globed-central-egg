# Globed Central Pterodactyl Egg
Globed is an open-source created by dankmeme01, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash. This is used for Pterodactyl Panel.
It's easy to use and can create servers in an instant.

## Usage
- Make sure you have [Globed](https://github.com/dankmeme01/globed2) already installed in your Geometry Dash through Geode
- Download both [egg-globed-game-server.json](https://github.com/DumbCaveSpider/globed-pterodactyl-egg/blob/main/egg-globed-game-server.json) and [egg-globed-central.json](https://github.com/DumbCaveSpider/globed-pterodactyl-egg/blob/main/egg-globed-central.json) and and export it into your Pterodactyl Panel in the Nest Section.
- Create two server, one for **Central Server** and another for **Game Server**, you can have multiple **Game Server** on a different node.

## Addtional Info
- Be sure to manually change the updated version to the latest on **Startup** tab since these servers do not auto update to the latest version of Globed whenever it updates so do manually update the version and reinstall the server. This only replace the required files and does not repalce your configuration.
- Default port for **Game Server** is `4202` and **Central Server** is `4201`.
