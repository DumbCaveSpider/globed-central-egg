# Globed Pterodactyl Egg
Globed is an open-source created by dankmeme01, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash. This is used for Pterodactyl Panel.
It's easy to use and can create servers in an instant.

## Usage
- Make sure you have [Globed](https://github.com/dankmeme01/globed2) already installed in your Geometry Dash through Geode
- Download both [egg-globed-game-server.json](https://github.com/DumbCaveSpider/globed-pterodactyl-egg/blob/main/egg-globed-game-server.json) and [egg-globed-central-server.json](https://github.com/DumbCaveSpider/globed-pterodactyl-egg/blob/main/egg-globed-central-server.json) and and export it into your Pterodactyl Panel in the Nest Section.
- Create two server, one for **Central Server** and another for **Game Server**.
- Config the provided `central-conf.json` from the **Central Server** and apply the settings to the startup configuration in the **Game Server**.

## Addtional Info
- Be sure to manually change the updated version to the latest on **Startup** tab since these servers do not auto update to the latest version of Globed whenever it updates. This will only replace the main file and does not repalce your configuration.
